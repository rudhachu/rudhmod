   SESSION_ID = "your-session-id"
   BOT_INFO = "YourName,YourBotName,YourImage/VideoUrl(Optional)"
   # Get more configuration options from config.js
   ```

4. **Run the Bot**  
   Start the bot by running the appropriate command in your terminal (depending on the platform you're using, such as Node.js or Docker).
